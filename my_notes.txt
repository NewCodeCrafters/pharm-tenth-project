CLI is actually interesting
it reduces workload for a programmer
It is fast
and also efficient
Good to use 
You just have to know a lot of commands
and also be able to execute them without fear
just strive harder to grt better 
and trust me you will be among the best
also pray to God for assistance
He is sure to help you
